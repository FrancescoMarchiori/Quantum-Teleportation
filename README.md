## ðŸŽ“ B. Sc. Thesis

This repository contains the code of the implementative part of my Bachelor's Thesis. The aim is to show how to implement quantum teleportation in different ways, by first performing simulations in different environments and finally using IBM Quantum Experience in order to perform it. However, also the execution on a real quantum computer is in this case limited inside the same chip, since it's not possible to have access to multiple machines and also have ad hoc classical channels between them.
